We are taking a peek at trends in living arrangements amongst young adults ages 25-34 in the US!

The data is sourced from the US Census Bureau from the years 1967 to 2021.

Living with your spouse is the most common living arrangement among young adults, though it has seen a steady downward trend since the 60's. This category has had a drop in popularity of more than half since 1967. Social norms in the US have generally trended towards conservative, and this is evident in the living arrangments seen here.

However, over the years, social norms have steadily leaned away from antiquated thinking. The data shows that women living with their partner has gone from 0% in 1967 to 17% in 2021.
